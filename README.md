# Golang Stock Trader


> An implementation of [IBM's Stock Trader](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/introducing-stocktrader/) example, built with Golang and the following software architecture and design styles: **Microservices Architecture**, **Vertical Slice Architecture** , **CQRS**, **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, **Event Driven Architecture**.

ðŸ’¡ The focus of this application is mostly on the technical side. It is not intended to be a fully fledged stock trading application. The features set will be small and simple.

ðŸŒ€ This Application is `in-progress` and I will add new features and technologies over time.
